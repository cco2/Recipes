Guacamole
======
Simple guacamole recipe.

Traditionally, guacamole was just a mixture of mashed avocado and salt. Avocado provides a strong creamy buttery flavor/texture.  Salt curbs some of the avocado's strong flavor.

Later on, people added in all types of ingredients. Acidity, usually in the form of lime. Onions and clantro for aromatics. Peppers for spice.

Focus on freshness of the ingredients.

## Ingredients
Makes 3 servings
* 2 large ripe avocado (Hass)
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1/2 medium red onion
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 lime
* Salt
* Pepper
* (Optional) Cilantro

## Tools
* 2 Bowls
* Masher
* Microplane or grater or garlic masher

## Steps
1. Soak red onion in water for ~15 minutes. This will curb the onion's bite.
### Prep Avocado
1. Place avocado flesh into bowl. Slice the avocado in half and use a spoon to remove the contents into a bowl.
1. Mash avocado until desired guacamole texture
1. Salt generously. I use 3 decent sized pinches
1. Juice lime into mixture
### Prep Aromatics
1. Finely grate garlic into another bowl
1. Finely dice onion and add to the garlic bowl
1. (Optional) Chop cilantro and add to mixture
1. Add salt. Salt will draw out moisture from the aromatics.
### Mix
1. Add aromatics bowl to mashed avocado bowl
1. Add olive oil
1. Mix the guacamole thorougly
1. Salt and pepper to taste
1. Place in fridge to chill for 30 minutes

## Additional Notes
* Typically need to use more salt than expected. Avocados need a lot of salt to upgrade their flavor.
* For more flavorful aromatics throughout the guacamole, salt and pre-grind the aromatics before adding them to the guacamole. Can do this with only a portion of the aromatics to preserve the texture of the aromatics.
* White onion gives a sharp bite to the guacamole. Yellow and red onions give a sweet flavor with less bite. I prefer the red onions.
* For more heat, dice one small serrano pepper and slowly add to mixture in small batches (only to taste)
* This recipe preserves a heavy avocado flavor and not have the onion, garlic, or tomato overpower the guacamole

## Common Questions
* Why olive oil?
    * As with most things in a guacamole recipe, olive oil is optional
    * Adds extra smoothness
    * Adds olive oil aroma
    * Seems to cut a bit of the avocado flavor (needs further testing)
* Some recipes use sour cream. Could we use it here?
    * Maybe. Will need to experiment
* Lime or white wine vinegar?
    * I prefer lime, but white wine vinegar can also work.
