Strawberry Cheesecake Macarons
======
Tasty not overly sweet cheesecake macarons

## Ingredients
* 3 egg whites, room temperature
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar (I personally put 1 1/2 or 1 1/3 to make less sweet)
* 1 cup superfine almond flour
* 3 drops of red food coloring (if wanted)

* 8 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup powdered sugar (I personally put 1/2 to make less sweet)
* 2 tablespoons milk

* strawberry jam

## Tools
* baking sheet
* mixer
* mixing bowls
* parchment paper
* piping bag


## Steps
1. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. Slowly add sugar while beating the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
2. Sift the powdered sugar and almond flour over the egg whites. Fold the dry mixture into the egg whites, giving the bowl a quarter turn every third fold. 
3. Once the batter reaches a lava-like consistency, add food coloring if desired.
4. Working quickly, put batter into the piping bag (you can use zip lock bag if you don't have a piping bag)
5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a circular motion, pipe 1½-inch (4-cm) dollops onto the baking sheet.
6. Let the cookies rest for 1 hour, until they are no longer wet to the touch and a skin forms on top.
7. Preheat the oven to 285ºF (140ºC).
8. When the cookies are dry to the touch, bake for 13-15 minutes, until they have risen. Let them cool for 10 minutes.

1. Make the filling by mixing the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and milk in a medium bowl until smooth.
2. Transfer to a piping bag and set aside until ready to fill the cookies.

1. To fill, pipe a circle of the cream cheese mixture around the edge of 1 cookie and place a small dollop of jam in the center, sandwich with another cookie.

## Additional Notes
* Tip: use a little batter to “glue” down the edges of the parchment paper so it stays put. Or use a special silicon baking sheet.
* Macarons are best kept refrigerated until serving.
