Spaghetti squash
======
A great way to try a new take on spaghetti

## Ingredients
* 1 spaghetti squash
* extra-virgin olive oil
* sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Tools
* kitchen knife
* fork and spoon
* baking sheet

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
1. Slice the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds and ribbing. Drizzle the inside of the squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
1. Place the spaghetti squash cut side down on the baking sheet and use a fork to poke holes. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned on the outside, fork tender, but still a litte bit firm. The time will vary depending on the size of your squash. I also find that the timing can vary from squash to squash.
1. Remove from the oven and flip the squash so that it’s cut side up. When cool to the touch, use a fork to scrape and fluff the strands from the sides of the squash.

## Additional Notes
* Add ground beef and mozerella when cooking and top with marinara for a new take on spaghetti  
* The flesh inside should be solid and brightly colored, corresponding to the spaghetti squash variety. If it has spots, is discolored or the color is very dull, it is going bad. If the flesh is soft and mushy, or appears very dry and is pulling away from the walls of the rind, the squash is rotten.
