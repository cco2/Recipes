- 2.5 qt baking dish
- Colander
- Spatula or wooden spoon
- Aluminum Foil
- (Optional) Baking sheet

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 350 &deg;F

### Pasta

1. Salt the boiling water to prevent pasta from sticking

1. Salt and pepper to taste
### Bake

1. (Optional) Place baking dish on baking tray to collect any possible leakage over the top during baking.
1. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. The foil makes the dish bake more evenly.
1. Put into oven for 45 minutes.
1. If you had a foil cover, remove the cover.
1. Continue cooking in oven for 30 minutes.
1. Remove from oven and rest for 30 minutes.

## Notes
You could bake this without the aluminum foil, but I found that the [resulting dish](images/mac-n-cheese-uncovered.jpg) comes out a bit burned at the top. The top was not any crispier either. Instead, just set the broiler on at the end to finish with a crispier top.

To spice up this recipe, do any/all of the following:
* Change the cheese sauce to use higher quality cheeses. Semi-firm cheese works well. Mix with sodium citrate additive as an emulsifier.
* Add a crispy topping like breadcrumbs during the baking process.
* Add extra spices/ingredients into the body of the mac and cheese.

## Common Questions
* Why use Kraft Deli Deluxe American Cheese?
   * Kraft Deli Deluxe American Cheese contains emulsifiers that thicken the cheese sauce. The emulsifiers help create a very smooth texture that is more difficult to replicate using a roux.
