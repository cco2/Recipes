Garlic Noodles
======
Very easy to make and delicious fusion dish (assuming you like garlic flavor). Originated from San Francisco. Garlic noodles are served typically as a side dish of seafood, but it is also good on its own. Lots of garlic!

## Ingredients
* 1/2 lb of spaghetti (bronze cut preferred for the starch). Other noodles will work as well
* 2 tbsp butter
* 12 cloves of minced garlic
* 2 tsp fish sauce (Squid brand is preferred)
* 2 tsp light soy sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce (lee kum kee with the boy on the front is preferred)
* 30g Parmesean or Pecorino cheese
* Sliced green onions

## Tools
* Pan for cooking noodles
* Pan for making dish

## Steps
1. Boil water and cook noodles to al dente. In parallel, continue with other steps to make sauce.
   * No need to add salt since the sauces all have lots of salt already.
   * Use less water so the water has higher concentration of starch, which will help with the emulsification of the sauce.
2. In other pan, add butter and start heating the pan on medium-low heat.
3. When butter melts, add minced garlic and lightly cook so garlic gives flavor to the butter. Should take about 1 minute.
4. Add soy sauce, fish sauce, and oyster sauce to the pan and mix.
5. Add noodles and some pasta water to the pan with sauce. Mix to coat the noodles with the sauce.
6. Add cheese and continue mixing. Sauce should be emulsifying and becoming creamy.
   * If sauce is tightening up, add more pasta water
   * If sauce is too loose, cook longer
7. Add some sliced green onions.
8. Mix and serve. Top with more green onions.
