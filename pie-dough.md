Pie Dough
======
Pie dough for two pies (top and bottom).

## Ingredients
Makes four pie crusts
* 4 cups of flour (measured after sifting)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 lb Crisco shortening (~2.5 cups)
* 1 cup cold water
* 1 egg (yolk and white separated)
* 1 tbsp vinegar (apple vinegar for extra taste if desired)

## Tools
* Flour Sifter
* Large mixing bowl
* Measuring cups
* Wax paper, or very large ziploc bag
* Optional
  * Pastry cutter/blender (pair of table knifes work fine)
  * Egg separator

## Steps
1. Make sure shortening and liquids are very cold. Refrigerate the in-progress dough if you need to pause for more than a few minutes.
1. Sift the flour into the mixing bowl, add the salt.
1. Add cold shortening, dice into flour using pastry cutter/pair of knives until shortening is pea sized.
1. Thoroughly mix together cold water, egg yolk, and vinegar
1. Create 'fountain' in the middle of the flour & shortening, poor the liquid in, mix well
1. Whip egg white, fold into the dough (try not to over mix)
1. Cover the dough with wax paper, or seal in the bag, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours

## Additional Notes
Using the dough
* Split the dough into 4 uneven parts (make the bottoms larger than the tops)
* Dough generally does not need parbaking, can be used raw for most pies.
* To roll, cover the counter and rolling pin (or other convenient round object) in flour. Roll from centre to edges in ever direction until the desired size is reached.
* Sealing the pie edges
    * Leave some dough overlapping the pie plates
    * Dab water with a finger between the pie halves
    * Press together with a fork all around the edges
* Vent holes aren't just for looks, makes sure you have at least a few around the centre of the pie.
* Cooking times vary by pie filling but generally:
    * 10 minutes at 425 F
    * Additional 30-35 minutes at 350 F

## Common Questions
* What do I do if I ate too much of the raw dough and I don't have enough to make a second pie?
    * Eat the rest of the dough
    * Make cookies
