Short description

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 lb Peek Frean shortbread cookies (**Important**: Walkers brand shortbread just doesn't seem to work well here)
* 1 cup very strong, cold coffee (cold-brew coffee works fine, adjust as needed based on concentration)
* 2 tbsp cacao
* 2 lb icing sugar
* 1/2 lb chopped walnuts
* 2 egg yolks
* Vanilla extract to taste (I like ~ 1 tbsp)

## Tools
* Bread pan
* Wax paper
* Big knife


## Steps
1. Chop cookies into ~ 1/2" chunks
1. Mix chopped cookies with walnuts and icing sugar
1. Mix coffee with cacao, egg yolks, vanilla extract
1. Gently mix with cookie mixture until even
1. Press into bread pan lined with wax paper (make sure there is enough paper to cover the top as well)
1. Cover the top with remaining wax paper, and press down to remove air
1. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours

## Additional Notes
* Prepare to large groups only, not recommended for individual consumption (you will regret it)
