# Sean's Chicken breast, Morels, and Sunchoke in a Creamy Pan Sauce

I just made this last night after picking up random things from WholeFoods I'd never tried before. It turned out so good, I needed to write it down somewhere.

## Tools
```
Stainless steel pan - (for generating fond for pan sauce)
Wooden spatula - (for scraping fond off pan)
A spatula or tongs - (for flipping and moving chicken)
Rice cooker (or some method for cooking rice)
Chef's knife
Garlic press - (helps, but not necessary)
Vegetable peeler
Small sauce pan
(optional) a cooking thermometer - (for checking for doneness)
```

## Ingredients
```
Olive oil (or another neutral cooking oil)
1 Large/thick Chicken Breast (or two thin chicken breast)
1 medium onion
6 cloves of garlic
2 tbsp of italian Parsley leaves
1-2 spring/green onions
1 cup of morel mushrooms
1 Sunchoke
2 Tbsp of Butter
1/2 cup of pecorino romano
1/2 cup of heavy cream
a pinch of saffron (5-10 stems)
1 tbsp of dried oregano
2 Cups of Jasmine rice
Salt
Pepper
```


## Directions

### Prepping the ingredients

<br>

```
Stainless steel pan
Small sauce pan
Chef's Knife
Vegetable Peeler
Garlic press
1 Sunchoke
1 Chicken Breast
6 cloves of garlic
1 cup of morel mushrooms
2 tbsp of italian Parsley leaves
1 medium onion
```


Start preheating stainless steel pan on low heat.

Fill a small sauce-pan with enough water to par-boil your sunchoke, and begin bringing it to a boil. Do not add the sunchoke yet!

Slice the chicken breast horizontally with the chef's knife to create two thinner chicken breasts. Salt and pepper all sides of the two breasts and set aside to dry brine.

Peel your sunchoke with the vegetable peeler. 

Peel your 6 cloves of garlic, smash 2 cloves just enough to begin releasing the garlic scent, either mince or use a garlic press on the other 4 cloves and set aside.

Chop your medium onion and parsley (the finer the better, but a rough chop will do).

Rough chop your morel mushrooms. If morels are wet, pat dry.

Check the heat of your pan w/ a drop of water. Adjust up or down according to this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-SCA1reqE).

### Cooking the chicken

<br>

```
Chicken filets
A spatula or tongs to flip chicken
(optional) a cooking thermometer to check for doneness
Olive oil (or another neutral cooking oil)
1 Tbsp of Butter
2 smashed cloves of garlic
1 sunchoke
```

Once your pan is to temp, add 1 tbsp of olive oil to the pan.

Add 1 tbsp of butter directly on top of the oil. Lift and tilt the pan to coat the entire surface with the oil mixture.

_note: if your butter starts to turn darker brown immediately when dropped in the pan, you started a little too hot. No worries, just remove the pan from the heat, reduce the temperature of the stove to low, add your two smashed cloves while the pan is off heat, and 30 seconds later place the pan back on the heat, raise the temp slightly, and continue with the instructions_

Add your 2 smashed garlic cloves to the pan and move them around for ~30 seconds to let the oil infuse with the garlic

Add the sunchoke, whole and peeled to your water which is hopefully boiling by now.

Lay your chicken breast filets into the hot oil, and let cook for 2 minutes per side (4 minutes total). Refuse the temptation to check the chicken or to move the chicken. 

Lower the heat to low and continue to cook the chicken, now covered, for 3 minutes on each side (6 minutes total). 

_note: If small amounts of the filet's crust are sticking to the pan, this is good, this is the fond that we will use to make the pan sauce_

Either by touch or by temperature, check that the chicken is cooked through.

Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and set aside on a plate.

Remove the garlic cloves from the pan and toss them in the trash.

Remove the sunchoke from the water and set on your cutting board.

### Creating the sauce

<br>

```
Wooden Spatula
Salt
Pepper
1/2 cup of pecorino romano
1/2 cup of heavy cream
a pinch of saffron (5-10 stems)
2 tbsp of roughly chopped parsley
1 tbsp of dried oregano
1 cup of water
1 medium onion, chopped
1 sunchoke, sliced and quartered
1 cup of chopped morel mushrooms
```

Cut your sunchoke into 1/4" slices; then, quarter the larger slices and halve the smaller slices.

Increase the heat to medium-medium-high.

Add the morel to your pan and toss them around enough to coat them in the oil mixture.

Add your sunchoke to the pan and toss to coat.

Be sure to not overcrowd the pan in order to avoid steaming the mushrooms and sunchoke.

Continue to cook the sunchoke and morel until light browning begins to occur on the edges of the sunchoke.

_note: The more you move and disturb the contents of the pan, the longer it will take to brown the sunchoke and the mushier the sunchoke will become._

Lower the heat to low.

Add another 1 tbsp of butter to the pan.

Add chopped onions to the pan, toss, and continue cooking until they begin to turn translucent (2-3min).

Add minced garlic to the pan, toss, and cook for another 45 seconds

Add 1 cup of water (_if you still have the sunchoke's boiling water, use that!_)

Add the parsley, the oregano and the saffron.

Using your wooden spatula, scrape the bottom of the pan to release the fond.

If needed, lower the heat so it is just a moderate simmer. 

Let the sauce simmer until it's reduced by half (5-7min).

Reduce the heat to low.

Add 1/2 cup of heavy cream and stir to incorporates

Add 1/2 cup of grated pecorino romano (or grated parmesan) and stir to incorporate.

Add in black pepper and salt to taste (likely will need no/very little salt b/c of the pecorino).

Turn off the heat.

Re-add the chicken filets to the sauce so they can begin to absorb the flavors of the sauce.

Spoon some of the sauce over the chicken to fully cover.

Cover the pan with a lid.

### Cooking the rice

<br>

```
2 Cups of Jasmine rice
3 cups of water
3-4 spring/green onions
Rice cooker
```

Rinse your rice and add it to the rice cooker

Add 3 cups of water to the rice cooker and cook according to your cooker's instructions

_note: For instant pot, I do a 7 minute manual, High pressure, cook with a 10min natural release._

Slice the onion into a garnish.

<br>

### Plating

<br>

```
Plates
Serving spoon for rice
Tongs for chicken
Chef's knife for chicken
Serving spoon for sauce
```

When the rice is almost done cooking, turn the sauce's heat back on low to loosen back up any sauce that may have begun to thicken.

Once the rice is done cooking, add rice to on side of your plate.

Take a filet from the pan and slice it into strips on your cutting board.

Place the sliced filet on your plate next to your rice.

Spoon a good helping of the sauce onto the chicken.

Sprinkle the spring/green onion onto your rice for garnish.

Enjoy!
