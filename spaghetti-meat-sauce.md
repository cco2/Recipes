One-pot recipe for a rich meat sauce for use on pasta.

## Ingredients
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 large onions, chopped
* 5 large garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 lb ground beef, extra lean
* 1 lb ground pork
* 4 to 5 bay leaves
* 7-8 dry pimientos, or 1 to 1.5 tsp of crushed red peppers
* 14 oz can of tomato juice
* 5.5 oz can of tomato paste
* salt & pepper
* (1 tbsp sugar if a sweet sauce is preferred)
* 1 cup finely diced mushrooms

## Tools
* Large pot
* Knife
* Garlic crusher (or chop garlic extra fine with knife)

## Steps
1. Fry garlic and onions in the pot with the olive oil
1. Push to the side
1. Brown meat, then mix with onions
1. Drain excess fat
1. Add remaining ingredients, except mushrooms:
    * bay leaves
    * peppers
    * tomato juice
    * tomato paste
    * salt & pepper
    * optional sugar (personally I prefer without)
1. Simmer (optimal is >= 3 hours, but even 60 minutes is enough if you are in a rush), mix occasionally
1. 30 minutes prior to serving, mix in finely diced mushrooms
1. Fish out bay leaves, and pimientos

## Additional Notes
* Gets better with every reheat
* Freezes very well
* Pairs well with parmesan on pasta
