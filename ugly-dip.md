Ugly Dip
======
Looks so bad, tastes so good

## Ingredients
* ~1 lb raw chicken breast OR ~1 lb pre-cooked & shredded chicken breast
* 1 package of Kraft shredded cheese (colby jack or sharp cheddar or mexican mix) (~2 cups)
* 1 package of chopped spinach
* 1 small package of sour cream (~4oz)
* 1 jar of Pace Picante - Medium salsa (~16oz)
* 1 can of black beans, rinsed & drained


## Tools
* a pot
* a spatula or something to stir with
* a can opener

If using raw chicken breast:
* instant pot or some other method to cook chicken breast
* hand mixer or some other method to shred chicken breast

## Steps
1. Mix together and heat in an oven at 350 until hot (~45min) or in a microwave.

If using raw chicken breast:
* heat in instant pot on high for 11min with a 1/3cup or so of water
* drain
* using a hand mixer, keeping the cooked chicken breast in a high walled pot (like the instant pot), tear apart the chicken
* then follow step 1

## Additional Notes
* If you double the recipe, only 1.5x the sour cream
* Easy to mix the night before and heat the next day
* It doesn't look very 'wet' when you first mix it together, but once it cooks through it creates its own juices to make it into a proper dip
* Best paired with plain Tostito's Scoops chips
* Leftovers makes great enchiladas or tacos
