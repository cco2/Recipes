Apple Bundt Cake
======
The perfect fall cake with slices of apple and a sweet glaze.

## Ingredients
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 1/2 cups packed light-brown sugar
* 4 large eggs
* 6 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced 1/4 inch thick
* 1 cup confectioners' sugar
* 1 to 2 tablespoons water

## Tools
* medium bowl
* large bowl
* whisk
* bundt pan
* rubber spatula
* Apple peeler (to prep apples)

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.
1. In a large bowl, combine butter, brown sugar, and eggs. Whisk until smooth. Gradually whisk in dry ingredients just until combined (do not overmix). Using a rubber spatula, fold in apples. Spoon batter into a 12-cup nonstick (or sprayed) Bundt pan, and smooth top. Bake until a tester inserted in cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in pan on rack 15 minutes; invert onto rack to cool completely.
1. Make the glaze: Whisk together confectioners' sugar and enough water to form a thick yet pourable glaze. Set rack with cake over a piece of wax paper (for easy cleanup); drizzle cake with glaze, and let set before serving.

## Additional Notes
* Granny Smith apples hold their shape well during baking and provide a sweet-tart taste.
