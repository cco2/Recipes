Bistek Tagalog
======
Filipino Beef Steak.

This is my mom's recipe. Compared to traditional bistek tagalog, this version yields more sauce, which is great with rice, and has no onions since my mom can't eat onions anymore.

## Ingredients
* 1 lb Sirloin Beef
* 7 cloves of Garlic
* 1 Lemon
* 1 Calimansi
* Oil
* Water
* Soy Sauce
* Pepper

## Tools
* Marinade bowl
* Pan

## Steps
### Marinade
1. Cut beef into thin slices and add to bowl
1. Juice lemon into bowl
1. Add 1 tbsp soy sauce and add to bowl
1. Slice 3 cloves of garlic and add to bowl
1. Mix well and cover
1. Let rest in fridge for a few hours (overnight is best)
### Cook
1. Roughly chop 4 cloves of garlic
1. In pan, add oil and heat garlic until slightly brown to infuse the oil with garlic
1. Add meat only and stir fry until brown
1. Add marinade and calimansi

## Additional Notes
