Guacamole
======
Simple guacamole recipe.

Traditionally, guacamole was just a mixture of mashed avocado and salt. Avocado provides a strong creamy buttery flavor/texture.  Salt curbs some of the avocado's strong flavor.

Later on, people added in all types of ingredients. Acidity, usually in the form of lime. Onions and clantro for aromatics. Peppers for spice.

Advice - Focus on what your audience prefers and the freshness of the ingredients.

## Ingredients
Makes 3 servings
* 2 large ripe avocado (Hass)
* 1 clove of garlic
* 1/4th large onion (white, yellow, or red)
* 1/2 ripe tomato
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 lime
* Salt
* Pepper
* (Optional) Cilantro

## Tools
* Bowl
* Masher

## Steps
### Prep
1. Finely chop garlic
1. Finely dice onion
1. Seed and finely dice tomato
### Mix
1. Place avocado flesh into bowl. One method is to slice the avocado in half, cut the flesh in a grid inside the skin, and use a spoon to remove the contents.
1. Mash avocado until desired guacamole texture
1. Add chopped garlic, onion, and tomato to mixture
1. Juice lime into mixture
1. Add olive oil
1. (Optional) Chop cilantro and add to mixture
1. Mix the guacamole thorougly
1. Salt and pepper to taste
1. Place in fridge to chill for 30 minutes

## Additional Notes
* Chop onion and tomato thicker to get a chunkier guacamole
* For more flavorful aromatics throughout the guacamole, salt and pre-grind the aromatics before adding them to the guacamole. Can do this with only a portion of the aromatics to preserve the original guacamole texture.
* White onion gives a sharp bite to the guacamole. Yellow and red onions give a sweet flavor with less bite.
* For more heat, dice one small serrano pepper and slowly add to mixture in small batches (only to taste)
* This recipe preserves a heavy avocado flavor and not have the onion, garlic, or tomato overpower the guacamole

## Common Questions
* Why olive oil?
    * As with most things in a guacamole recipe, olive oil is optional
    * Adds extra smoothness
    * Adds olive oil aroma
    * Seems to cut a bit of the avocado flavor (needs further testing)
* Some recipes use sour cream. Could we use it here?
    * Maybe. Will need to experiment
* Lime or white wine vinegar?
    * I prefer lime, but white wine vinegar can also work.
