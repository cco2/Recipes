Cacio e Pepe
======

## Ingredients
Makes 4 servings
* 2.5 oz Pecorino Romano cheese (Freshly Grated)
* 5.5 oz freshly grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese
* 1 tbsp Black Peppercorn (i.e. Tellicherry)
* 1lb Pasta (Spaghetti)
* Olive oil
* Water
* Salt

## Tools
* Blender
* Pot

## Steps
1. In pot, bring water to boil.
2. Add pasta and salt to pot
3. Cook pasta to close to al dente. For my spaghetti, this was 7 minutes.
4. In a blender, combine:
   * 1 cup starchy pasta water
   * Black peppercorn
   * Pecorino romano cheese
   * Parmesan cheese
5. Start blender and slowly add in olive oil until sauce is emulsified and has a creamy texture
6. Combine pasta and sauce. Top with additional cheese and ground pepper. Serve.

## Additional Notes
* Key to the getting the creamy texture is the concentration of starch in the pasta water. Use as little water with the pasta to have a higher concentration of starch.
