1. Mix until you get a creamy cheese paste. If needed, add more pasta water to get the right consistency.
### Combine

1. When pasta is almost at al dente, use tongs to remove pasta from pot and add to pan

## Additional Notes
* Key to the getting the creamy texture is the concentration of starch in the pasta water. Use as little water with the pasta to have a higher concentration of starch.
