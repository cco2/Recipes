Adobo Chicken
======


## Ingredients
* 1lb chicken thigh
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/3 cup white vinegar
* 1-2 cups of chicken stock
* 1 tbsp whole peppercorn
* 3-4 bay leaves
* Neutral oil (I use vegetable oil)
* 8 garlic cloves

## Tools
* Saute pan (Lid optional)
* Bowl for marinading the chicken
* (Optional) Splatter-guard or lid

## Steps
### Marinade
1. Add chicken thigh and soy sauce into marinade bowl
1. Grate 4 cloves of garlic
1. Mix well.
1. Cover and place in fridge for at least 2 hours

### Cook
1. Brown chicken thigh
    1. Add oil to saute pan over medium heat
    1. When oil is hot, place chicken thighs into pan.
        1. Warning: There can be oil splattering here. Use splatter-guard or lid to shield
    1. After about 5-7 minutes, flip chicken thigh and cook on other side for another 5 minutes.
        1. With browning any meat, the meat should easily release from the bottom of the pan when ready to flip. If the meat does not release easily, leave it be.
1. Create sauce in pan with chicken
    1. Add the remaining marinade from the bowl into the pan
    1. Add chicken stock, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves to the pan
    1. Bring heat down to simmer
    1. Simmer for 20 minutes
    1. (Optional) If you want a more liquidy sauce, place lid on to preserve the water content. Otherwise leave the lid off.
1. Finish dish
    1. Add vinegar to pan
    1. Simmer for 10 minutes
    1. Taste sauce and apply adjustments. Repeat adjustments until satisfied with taste.
        1. If too bitter, add salt and/or soy sauce
        1. If no bitter taste, add white vinegar
        1. If not enough kick, add ground black pepper
        1. If too thick, add chicken stock or water
        1. If too thin, heat uncovered to thicken
